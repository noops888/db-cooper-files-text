**Response streaming in AutoRAG binding added**

AutoRAG now supports response streaming in the `AI Search` method of the [Workers binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/autorag/usage/workers-binding/), allowing you to stream results as theyâre retrieved by setting `stream: true`.

**AutoRAG is now in open beta!**

AutoRAG allows developers to create fully-managed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines powered by Cloudflare allowing developers to integrate context-aware AI into their applications without managing infrastructure. Get started today on the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/autorag).
