If you will make these fingerprints available to this agency, they will be for- warded to our Identification Division where they will be compared with latent impressions that were located on the skyjacked air- craft. In the event the Identification Division is unable to identify the fingerprints you submit as identical with the latent impressions from the aircraft, you will be advised by letter, within five business days of completion of the examination. This letter will be sent to you by registered mail, at the above address. A copy will also be sent to your attorney,\nb6 b7c\nIf an identification is not made it may be because your fingerprints and the latent impressions are not from the same individual or because the fingerprints you submit or impres- sions from the aircraft are from different portions of the same hands and therefore are not comparable.\nVery truly yours, Palik- 6/18/50\nPaul L.",

B. \".\nThat story and the words in their entirety are: \"He was cool, he was calm, the man with the \"bomb\", who boarded flight 36 with ease. And pilot Bill Scott, not suspecting the plot, took off with the man called D. B. They were just in the air, when the stew caught the stare, of the man in the back of the plane. He passed her a paper, which he thought she'd read later, she thought him a flirt and quite vain. \"Read the note,\" his wave told, and she thought him quite bold, to make such a pass in mid flight. But she did as he asked, and she read and she gasped, as the jet flew on into the night. The crew was quite shocked, to find this short hop, this all stop, short hop flight skyjacked.\nBAB:val (2)\n164-81-8387 SEARCHED INDEXED SERIALIZED 4 1 FILED 14\nE\nBuy U.",
